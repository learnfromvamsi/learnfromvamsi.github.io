            <li>
              <p>
                English, just like any other language, is used to communicate
                with others and understand the society around us..One advantage
                of learning english is,with its help we can understand other societies
                as well..
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Every civilization that ever existed figured out something
                that's previously unknown and passed that knowledge to their
                next generations in their respective languages through oral
                teachings or writings or in many cases both..If we know their language,we can find
                information about all those societies through books. we can
                read those books, learn from those books...Thanks to translators we don't need to know all languages.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As you all know,Just like every language, there are rules and
                structures for english language.Every teacher has his/her own
                way of teaching and i am thankful to all my teachers,
                escpecially to my 10th class english sir late Mr.Shabbir sir for
                this valuable
                <a href="English Notes.pdf" target="_blank">English Notes</a>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h2>Reading and writing</h2>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The next obvious step to do after learning  English grammar is developing
                reading and writing skills...that is the most important favour
                you can do to yourself.
              </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Here is a good dialogue from the movie inception "once an idea has
              taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate
              it..an idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that
              sticks..right in there somewhere"
            </li>
            <li>
              It's more likely that you'll remember something/word for a long
              time if you understand it fully or if you like how the word
              sounds.
            </li>

          <h2>Proverbs(సామెతలు),Idioms & Quotes</h2>

            <li>
              <p>
                One of the best ways humans figured out to pass their knowledge
                to the next generations is through Proverbs and Sayings, at
                least in philosophical perspective.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At some point of time we have all seen workers using leveling
                pipe in construction works.It is based on the Proverb "Water
                always finds its own level"...People have been using that as a
                technique for thousands of years...For example,The Romans
                constructed Aqueducts using that principle 2000 years back.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                An idiom is an expression or phrase used to convey a particular
                meaning that would otherwise be a different one when considered
                the real meanings of the words used in that particular
                expression or phrase.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ex:- the idiom "piece of cake" means "To be easy"..But when the
                original meanings of the words are considered the meaning would
                be different.
              </p>

            Here is a dialogue from the tv show "Supernatural" in which the
            character Crowley threatens other demons saying "No one in the
            history of torture's been tortured with torture like the torture
            you'll be tortured with"...The way he delivers that dialogue is very
            funny and makes learning tongue twisters interesting...Here are some
            of the Tongue twisters i can find...
